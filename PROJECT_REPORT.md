🧾 1. Professional Project Report – Stock Movement Prediction App

📘 Project Title:
"Stock Movement Prediction using Machine Learning and Flask"

🎯 Objective:
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a stock’s price will go up or down based on various financial indicators. The system was then deployed as a Flask web app to provide instant, user-friendly predictions.

📂 Dataset:
File Used: stock_features.csv & GME_stock.csv
Data Description:
The dataset includes stock-related features such as:
Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close prices
Volume
Average Price, Moving Averages (MA10, MA50), VWAP
Daily Return Percentage, Price Range
Target variable (target_updown) representing stock movement direction (1 = Up, 0 = Down)

⚙️ Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing
Dropped unnecessary columns (date)
Separated features (X) and target (y)
Applied StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler using ColumnTransformer
Handled pipeline automation for transformation + modeling

3. Model Training
Tested multiple ML algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
SVM
KNN
Naive Bayes
Best Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier

Base Accuracy: 88.9%

3. Model Optimization
Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning with parameters:
param_grid = {
    'Model__n_estimators': [50, 100, 150, 200],
    'Model__learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1],
    'Model__max_depth': [3, 5, 7]
}

✅ Best Model Accuracy: ~89%
✅ Cross-Validation Mean Score: 0.877
✅ Confusion Matrix:

[[439  54]
 [ 52 410]]

4. Feature Importance
Top contributing features:
Daily Return %
VWAP
MA10
Average Price
Volume
Visualized using Matplotlib bar chart.

5. Model Deployment
Deployed using Flask with an interactive web interface:
User enters stock details (open, high, low, close, volume, etc.)
Model predicts stock movement:

📈 “Stock will go UP”
📉 “Stock will go DOWN”

Frontend styled with modern CSS (gradient background, animations, glowing effects) for a professional look.
